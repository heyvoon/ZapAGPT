## ZapAGPT Facilitating Communication for the Visually Impaired üë®‚Äçü¶Ø

**Project Description:**

The "ZapAGPT" project aims to develop an innovative mobile application that will assist visually impaired people in using WhatsApp through voice technology and ChatGPT. The idea came from the personal need of the creator, Andr√© Barbosa, who has a visually impaired brother and faces difficulties in maintaining more fluid and independent contact with him, since they live far apart.

The "ZapAGPT" application will be an inclusive and practical solution to allow visually impaired people to use WhatsApp through voice interactions, making communication more accessible and efficient for this community. With the help of ChatGPT, an advanced natural language processing technology, the application will allow users to receive and send messages through voice commands, eliminating the need to type text.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Support and Collaboration: ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**The "ZapAGPT" project is currently in the fundraising phase through a crowdfunding campaign to finance the development of the application. The collaboration of the community and interested partners is essential to make this initiative a reality that will transform lives. Soon, we will have links to the crowdfunding platforms here, so stay tuned!**

**With everyone's support and engagement, "ZapAGPT" will open paths for digital inclusion and significantly contribute to equal opportunities and access to communication for visually impaired people worldwide. Together, we can make a difference and promote inclusion in an innovative and impactful way!**

**Main Features:**

   - The project will seek to raise awareness in the community about the importance of digital inclusion and the need for accessible solutions for visually impaired people.
   - The application aims to positively impact the lives of visually impaired people, providing greater independence and autonomy in communication.

   - In public environments, the user can choose privacy and save the message to listen to later.
   - Received messages, even if sent by text, will be transformed into audio for a more accessible experience.

3. **Sending Messages by Voice:**
   - The application will replace the standard voice assistant (Google Assistant) on Android devices, allowing the user to activate the application with a specific keyword.
   - By saying "Send message to [Contact Name]", the application will recognize the recipient and ask the user to dictate the message.
   - After receiving the message, ChatGPT will confirm the action and send the message to the selected recipient.

4. **Ease of Use and Accessibility:**
   - The application interface will be designed to be friendly and easy to navigate for visually impaired people.

**Expected Impact:**

"ZapAGPT" has the potential to benefit not only the creator's brother but also the entire visually impaired community around the world. By allowing more accessible, immediate, and independent communication through WhatsApp, the application can improve the quality of life of millions of visually impaired people, providing a more inclusive communication channel and connecting them with their family members, friends, and contacts more effectively.
